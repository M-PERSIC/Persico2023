# Periodic Meeting Notes

## What I accomplished

- [X] [First Yggdrasil port w/ Hayagriva merged](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/6682)
- [x] [Port MUSCLE to Yggdrasil](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/6837) 
- [X] [Include MacOS build for MUSCLE on Yggdrasil](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/6838)

### Notes

- Windows/FreeBSD builds will be challenging for all 3 (MAFFT, MUSCLE, Clustal-Omega) JLL packages. There are subtle intricacies with each of their build systems:
    - Both MAFFT and Clustal-Omega rely on a separate CMake build flow for Windows
    - 64-bit executables for MUSCLE are not well supported for Windows via MingW ([Building under Cygwin on Windows](https://github.com/rcedgar/muscle/wiki/Building-MUSCLE#building-under-cygwin-on-windows))
    - No mentions of FreeBSD builds with the exception of [Clustal-Omega](http://www.clustal.org/omega/)
- Slow development due to commitments and some sudden events (school, volunteering, family-related). These are now settled thus I can proceed to fully dedicate myself to the JSoC. 

## What I plan to do next week

### Priority

#### A

- [ ] Port Clustal-Omega to Yggdrasil 
    - [ ] Initial Linux build
    - [ ] MacOS build (contact James Foster)
- [ ] Initial MUSCLE.jl project repo
    - [ ] README to match BioJulia template
    - [ ] Basic input/output support with regular FASTA-formatted files 
    - [ ] Basic input/output support with the `FASTX.FASTA.Record` type
    - [ ] Basic tests
    - [ ] Basic documentation

#### B

- [ ] Develop draft BioJuliaDocs integration plan
    - [ ] Initial BioJuliaDocs (SciMLDocs fork) repo
    - [ ] Contact @maltesie for potential [BioTutorials](https://github.com/BioJulia/BioTutorials) integration
    - [ ] Contact @kool7d for potential [BioMakie](https://github.com/kool7d/BioMakie.jl) integration
    - [ ] Publish draft issue outlining the integration plan
    - [ ] Invite community (Slack, Discourse)

### Low priority

#### A
- [ ] Clustal-Omega JLL FreeBSD build
- [ ] Complete coverage of every optional feature supported for MUSCLE
    - MUSCLE is fairly minimal, see [manpage](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/focal/man1/muscle.1.html)
- [ ] Initial MAFFT.jl project repo
- [ ] Initial ClustalO.jl project repo

#### B
- [ ] Contact @ChrisRackauckas concerning BuildKite/CI internals of SciMLDocs

#### Other

- [ ] Convert project hub into a proper GitHub project ([About Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects))
    - [ ] Set up 2 separate projects: JSoC and BIOL490
    - [ ] Add labels: A, B, other, todo, muscle, mafft, clustalo, bioalignments, stretch goal
    - [ ] Set up built-in automation ([Configure built-in automation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/quickstart-for-projects#configure-built-in-automation))

### Explore

#### B

- Pluto integration into BioJuliaDocs ([Using HTML export of Pluto within Documenter.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl/discussions/1345))
- Brush up on technical writing skills ([Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/overview))

#### Other

- First pull request to a package in the BioJulia ecosystem

## Is there anything that Kevin can help with?

All good :)

## Periodic survey

This week, (check all that apply):

- [ ] I accomplished all or most of my goals
- [ ] I used my time wisely
- [X] I struggled with a problem, but solved it
- [ ] I ran into an issue I could not solve on my own.
