    - [X] Setup repo (pull request approvals, actions,...)
    - [X] Generate GitHub project board
    - [X] Invite community (Slack, Discourse)

#### Other

- [X] First pull request to BioJulia
    - [X] Enable `documenter-dark` theme for ReadDatastores.jl (https://github.com/BioJulia/ReadDatastores.jl/pull/19)
- [X] Contact @maltesie for potential [BioTutorials](https://github.com/BioJulia/BioTutorials) integration (no word yet)
- [X] Contact @kool7d for potential [BioMakie](https://github.com/kool7d/BioMakie.jl) integration
- [ ] Generate Bowtie/Bowtie2 JLL package 
    - [X] Add libsais dependency (https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7029)
    - [X] Add SIMDe dependency (awaiting merge - https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7035)
    - [ ] Generate Bowtie2 build recipe
    - [ ] Generate Bowtie build reicpe

### Notes

#### A

- I'm pushing back the previous MUSCLE.jl goals to next week. I want to dedicate more time to studying BioPython/BioConductor implementations of MSA as well as good patterns for wrappers of external programs 

#### Other

- Porting to BinaryBuilder/Yggdrasil is quite fun, and I got a good handle of it, therefore I can offer to port other essential bio packages like Bowtie/Bowtie2 as discussed [on your Slack thread](https://julialang.slack.com/archives/C67TK21LJ/p1683917509420419)

## What I plan to do this week

- I have a volunteering event which will consume most of my time the week of July 10th
- I will focus on porting Bowtie/Bowtie2 to Yggdrasil and adding additional sections/ideas to BioJuliaDocs

#### B

- [ ] Flesh out the "Comparison With Other Packages/Ecosystems" section
    - [ ] BioJulia vs BioPython
    - [ ] BioJulia vs BioConductor
- [ ] Generate basic outline (what's included in "Getting Started",...)

#### Other

- [ ] Generate Bowtie/Bowtie2 JLL package 
    - [ ] Generate Bowtie2 build recipe
    - [ ] Generate Bowtie build reicpe
- [ ] Gather feedback for other packages to be ported to BinaryBuilder/Yggdrasil for BioJulia

## Is there anything that Kevin can help with?

- All good!

## Periodic survey

This week, (check all that apply):

- [ ] I accomplished all or most of my goals
- [X] I used my time wisely
- [ ] I struggled with a problem, but solved it
