[Link to last meeting notes](./2023-07-10.md)<!-- Edit this link to the date of the last meeting -->

#### B

- [X] Flesh out the "Comparison With Other Packages/Ecosystems" section (later today - 2023-07-20)
    - [X] BioJulia vs BioPython
    - [X] BioJulia vs BioConductor
- [X] Generate basic outline (what's included in "Getting Started",...) (later today - 2023-07-20)

#### Other

- [X] Generate Bowtie/Bowtie2 JLL package 
    - [X] Generate Bowtie2 build recipe (https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7051)
    - [X] Generate Bowtie (v1) build recipe (https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7069)
- [X] Gather feedback for other packages to be ported to BinaryBuilder/Yggdrasil for BioJulia (https://julialang.slack.com/archives/CAKKFNYLD/p1689685204319719)


### Notes

- Presently gearing up for JuliaCon so am tackling some smaller projects this week that can be finished before I leave on July 24
- Should arrive in Boston on the afternoon of July 24

## What I plan to do this week

<!-- Note: For longer-term goals or tasks, also add to project notes or to appropriate project repository -->
- As I am gearing up for JuliaCon, will look to address some minor items including further ports and generating more ideas for BioJuliaDocs
- I looked into the Franklin.jl source code and I think there is an opportunity for a first pull request:
    - Currently, Franklin.jl relies on [html-css-js-minify](https://github.com/juancarlospaco/css-html-js-minify/tree/master) which requires Python3 as a dependency
    - [I recently ported Minify](https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7067) which is a minifier written in Go. It can work on more files than the Python3 package (JSON, SVG, and XML files), can be built into a single executable without any external dependency, and runs [much faster](https://github.com/tdewolff/minify#time-lower-is-better)
    - My pull request would focus on replacing html-css-js-minify with the minify_jll package and thus eliminate the Python3 dependency as well as grant additional minification functionality 

#### Other

- [] Port IQ-Tree to Yggdrasil (requires Eigen3, Zlib)
    - [] Generate IQ-Tree build recipe
- [] Port KMA Aligner to Yggdrasil
    - [] Generate KMA Aligner build recipe (requires Zlib)
- [] Franklin.jl pull request
    - [] Add minify_jll dependency
    - [] Remove html-css-js-minify, .py files
    - [] Update documentation
    - [] Submit pull request

## Is there anything that Kevin can help with?

- I would like to setup a project board [as discussed on Slack](https://julialang.slack.com/archives/CAKKFNYLD/p1689703789780049?thread_ts=1689685204.319719&cid=CAKKFNYLD) so the BioJulia community can better track package ports. I am not a member of the org on GitHub so I need an organizer to create one/grant me permission to work on the project board
- Let me know when would be best to meet you/Guilherme in Boston :)

## Periodic survey

This week, (check all that apply):

- [ ] I accomplished all or most of my goals
- [ ] I used my time wisely
- [X] I struggled with a problem, but solved it
- [ ] I ran into an issue I could not solve on my own.
