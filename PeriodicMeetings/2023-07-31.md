# Periodic Meeting Notes

## What I accomplished last week

[Link to last meeting notes](./2023-07-24.md)<!-- Edit this link to the date of the last meeting -->

#### Other

- [X] Franklin.jl minify feature attempt 
    - [X] Add minify_jll dependency (https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7067)
    - [X] Remove html-css-js-minify, .py files
    - [X] Add necessary bits to make minification work
    - [X] Update documentation
    - [X] Submit pull request (https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl/pull/1038)

### Notes

- Franklin.jl is in maintenance mode whilst Xranklin is being developed, therefore an issue has been created in Xranklin to discuss adding the minifier (https://github.com/tlienart/Xranklin.jl/issues/253). Barring lack of time from working on BioJulia projects, another pr could be made by the end of the week.

## What I plan to do this week

#### A

- [ ] Flesh out MUSCLE.jl
    - [ ] Create wrapper functions for all "Manipulate ensembles" functions
    - [ ] Add doc comments to "Manipulate ensembles" functions
    - [ ] Generate the main documentation page for MUSCLE.jl (Documenter.jl)
- [ ] Outline skeleton BioAlignments MSA interface 
    - [ ] Internal representation (necessary types/interfaces in BioAlignments)
    - [ ] I/O interface (how to convert data between programs and BioAlignments)
    - [ ] Visualizer interface (how should the multiple sequence alignment be represented/how to consume the output of each program into a common interface,...)
        - Hopefully if I can flesh out this part I would like to discuss with you virtually sometime next week, ideally Wednesday as I will be busy thereafter

#### B

- [ ] Add "Installing BioJulia Sofware" section similar to [Installing SciML Software](https://docs.sciml.ai/Overview/stable/getting_started/installation/#installation)
- [ ] Flesh out additional comparison sections
    - [ ] Finish Biopython/Bioconductor sections
    - [ ] Add scikit-bio comparison section
    - [ ] Add BioPerl comparison section
- [ ] Initial skeleton/example for a "day in the life" series of sections
    - It would be an excellent creative writing exercise to demonstrate a biologist/bioinformatician/geneticist's, etc. workflow and how Julia/what BioJulia packages would fit in to it. The section would have the reader follow them along based on how members of the BioJulia community utilize Julia/BioJulia in their own fields
- [ ] Add all BioJulia dependencies to BioJuliaDocs initially (see next point)
- [ ] Add issue/discussion component for the community to decide the status of all BioJulia packages and their readiness for inclusion/exclusion from BioJuliaDocs
- [ ] Add devcontainer.json definition

#### Other

- [ ] Attempt BioJulia community requests for JLL ports
    - [ ] Silvar (https://github.com/brentp/slivar)
    - [ ] Samtools (https://github.com/samtools/samtools)
- [ ] Xranklin minifer pr

### Explore

- Brainstorm novel CI ideas that can leverage BuildKite
    - I spoke to Elliot Saba during JuliaCon, and it may be more than possible that the BioJulia organization can utilize BuildKite services for absolutely free! I would like to discuss with the community if there are any potential use cases that could benefit greatly from BuildKite (reduce dependence on GitHub for a more open-source alternative, take advantage of the enhanced flexibility for more exotic CI applications,...)

## Is there anything that Kevin can help with?

- I offer to help you with some of your own BioJulia initiatives including [remaking some of the contributing guidelines](https://github.com/orgs/BioJulia/discussions/11) (I think the idea of a template BioJulia repo would also be a great addition) and the website if you need any!
- Please do keep me posted on your health as the week progresses

## Periodic survey

This week, (check all that apply):

- [X] I accomplished all or most of my goals
- [ ] I used my time wisely
- [ ] I struggled with a problem, but solved it
- [ ] I ran into an issue I could not solve on my own.

Spent a whole lot of time at JuliaCon absorbing everything I could, networking with fellow peers and esteemed academics such as yourself, all the while managing to squeeze in some work benefitting the Julia community at large. I feel greatly energized and envision a very fruitful August productivity-wise.
