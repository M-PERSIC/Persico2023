# Periodic Meeting Notes

## What I accomplished last week

[Link to last meeting notes](./2023-08-07.md)

#### B

- [X] Add "Installing BioJulia Software" section similar to [Installing SciML Software](https://docs.sciml.ai/Overview/stable/getting_started/installation/#installation) (https://github.com/BioJulia/BioJuliaDocs/pull/9)
- [X] Flesh out additional comparison sections
    - [X] Finish Biopython/Bioconductor sections
    - [X] Add scikit-bio comparison section
    - [X] Add BioPerl comparison section
    - [X] Add BioRuby comparison section
    - [X] Add BioJava comparison section
- [X] Initial skeleton/example for a "day in the life" series of sections
    - It would be an excellent creative writing exercise to demonstrate a biologist/bioinformatician/geneticist's, etc. workflow and how Julia/what BioJulia packages would fit in to it. The section would have the reader follow them along based on how members of the BioJulia community utilize Julia/BioJulia in their own fields
- ~~Add all BioJulia dependencies to BioJuliaDocs initially (see next point)~~ **See notes below**
- ~~Add issue/discussion component for the community to decide the status of all BioJulia packages and their readiness for inclusion/exclusion from BioJuliaDocs~~ **See notes below**
- [X] Add devcontainer.json definition

#### Other

- [X] Attempt BioJulia community requests for JLL ports
    - [X] bcftools (https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7157)
    - [X] abPOA (https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7144)
    - [X] WFA2 (https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/Yggdrasil/pull/7145)
- ~~Xranklin minifer pr~~
### Notes

#### A

- I unfortunately need more time for both MUSCLE and the interface. I actually found that BioPython, BioJava and some other packages actually possess their own
  MSA wrappers so I want to look over them

#### B

- When attempting to add all dependencies together, the result failed due to some compat constraints (BioSequences was usually the main culprit). I have an idea:
    - Instead of trying to add every dependency to BioJuliaDocs, make an "OmniBio" package similar to https://github.com/JuliaComputing/OmniPackage.jl. This
      would essentially be a non-published metapackage useful for testing/benchmarking the entire BioJulia ecosystem of packages together. Afterwards it would
      be as trivial as "add OmniBio" in the BioJuliaDocs Project.toml file (I'm thinking it could be accessible via git submoduling, I need to test it) 

#### Other

- Silvar is probably NOT packageable yet (is mostly written in Nim), ported over bcftools in its place
- Samtools (community request) has already been ported :)
- Mos√® is currently on vacation so I am waiting for merge approvals for the Yggdrasil packages
- Thibault [got back to me](https://github.com/tlienart/Xranklin.jl/issues/253#issuecomment-1666950481) at the end of Sunday. He asked for some changes as
  he wishes to make minimizing opt-in without package extensions   

## What I plan to do this week

I have a military test and first-aid relicensing course taking place this week which will eat up most of my time. With the major work towards Project B last week, I will focus mostly on Project A and the Xranklin pr. 

#### A

- [ ] Flesh out MUSCLE.jl
    - [ ] Create wrapper functions for all "Manipulate ensembles" functions
    - [ ] Add doc comments to "Manipulate ensembles" functions
    - [ ] Generate the main documentation page for MUSCLE.jl (Documenter.jl)
- [ ] Outline skeleton BioAlignments MSA interface 
    - [ ] Internal representation (necessary types/interfaces in BioAlignments)
    - [ ] I/O interface (how to convert data between programs and BioAlignments)
    - [ ] Visualizer interface (how should the multiple sequence alignment be represented/how to consume the output of each program into a common interface,...)

#### B

- [ ] Develop the OmniBio package
    - [ ] Project template/publish GitHub repo
    - [ ] Test which package combinations fail
    - [ ] Open discussion on Slack/GitHub repo 
- [ ] Flesh out first "case scenario" section (course teaching and lesson planning) 

#### Other

- [ ] Xranklin pr 
- [ ] Port Polars over to Yggdrasil (I have VERY long-term idea for a Polars Julia wrapper that others have also expressed interest in, this would be the last item on my TODO list this week assuming I can finish everything else)

## Is there anything that Kevin can help with?

- Feedback on the OmniBio package idea (yay or nay)
- I'd like to have a discussion with the BioJulia community on having packages set to the latest LTS release (1.6). Mixing both LTS and non-LTS packages can
  cause some incompatibilities (ex.: BioSequences compat issues mentioned previously) and it would be good to set a baseline for when users are 
  contributing to BioJulia package development. Some other advantages include a unified devcontainer schema (set to the LTS channel) and no longer relying on
  deprecated/non-recommended pre-1.6 code/practices. What would be your thoughts on the matter?

## Periodic survey

This week, (check all that apply):

- [ ] I accomplished all or most of my goals
- [ ] I used my time wisely
- [X] I struggled with a problem, but solved it
- [ ] I ran into an issue I could not solve on my own.
