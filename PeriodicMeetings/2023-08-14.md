# Periodic Meeting Notes

## What I accomplished last week

[Link to last meeting notes](./2023-08-07.md)<!-- Edit this link to the date of the last meeting -->

### Priority

#### A

- [X] Flesh out MUSCLE.jl
    - [X] Create wrapper functions for all "Manipulate ensembles" functions
    - [X] Add doc comments to "Manipulate ensembles" functions
    - [X] Generate the main documentation page for MUSCLE.jl (Documenter.jl)

#### B

- [X] Develop the OmniBio package
    - [X] Project template/publish GitHub repo
    - [X] Test which package combinations fail
    - [X] Open discussion on Slack/GitHub repo 
- [X] Flesh out first "case scenario" section (course teaching and lesson planning) 

### Notes

#### A

 - Need more time for the MSA interface, apologies

#### Other

- Pushed the Xranklin pr to this week's list of tasks
- Polars lacks proper FFI to be ported as a JLL (see [Julia interface for polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/issues/547)), will focus instead on porting SeqAn over, though it will take more than one week as it's very large with a lot of different software components

## What I plan to do this week

- Just need 1-2 more days for fleshing out the initial draft for MSAs
- With MUSCLE.jl relatively fleshed out in terms of structure, I have a better idea on how to structure the wrappers and can begin working on ClustalO.jl

#### A

- [ ] Outline skeleton BioAlignments MSA interface (1-2 more days needed)
    - [ ] Internal representation (necessary types/interfaces in BioAlignments)
    - [ ] I/O interface (how to convert data between programs and BioAlignments)
    - [ ] Visualizer interface (how should the multiple sequence alignment be represented/how to consume the output of each program into a common interface,...)
- [ ] Continue work on MUSCLE.jl
  - [ ] Add examples to each command
  - [ ] Flesh out docs
  - [ ] Initial tests
- [ ] Flesh out ClustalO.jl
    - [ ] Create wrapper functions for all "Manipulate ensembles" functions
    - [ ] Add doc comments to "Manipulate ensembles" functions
    - [ ] Generate the main documentation page for MUSCLE.jl (Documenter.jl) 

#### B

- [ ] Add additional case scenario (startup solutions in biotech)
- [ ] Initial top navbar with links to BioJulia documentation

#### Other

- [ ] Xranklin pr

### Explore

- SeqAn (v2) JLL port
 
## Is there anything that Kevin can help with?

All good!

## Periodic survey

This week, (check all that apply):

- [ ] I accomplished all or most of my goals
- [X] I used my time wisely
- [ ] I struggled with a problem, but solved it
- [ ] I ran into an issue I could not solve on my own.

Passed both my first military exam and first aid relicensing!
